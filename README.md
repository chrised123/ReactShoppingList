## React Shopping List

This project is a personal project created by me. The goal of this app is me learning react. So, any inputs, suggestions or even issues are welcome. (I am still a novice in React. So, go easy on me)

- I am using ant design framework
- Once you add an item, the cursor automatically focusses back on the input
- you can mark an item important, toggle it, and even remove it
- currently its persisted using localstorage

### Future plans include

- ~~adding the swipe functionality - one side is important toggle and the other side is removal~~
- introducing an image search based on the text (similar to google shopping list)
- more features? maybe a unit indicator and price predictor
- redux or mobx
